  <h1>Christopher's website</h1>
  <p><em>This is the inside of my paragraph, i am still at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eton_College">school</a> and I love programming. For practice, this entire text will be in italics</em> Hopefully, this next part <em> <strong>will hopefully also be in italics but bold as well.
        Great!</strong></em></p>
  <br><br>
  <p>This is my next paragraph hopefully it autosaves because now it needs to</p>
  <hr size="3">
  <p>There should be a paragraph above this as well</p>
  <h3>My current projects</h3>
  <p>the above was written as a level three heading, my projects are very many so i won't list them :)</p>
  <p>now i will actually list them, practicing the use of the "ul" and "li" tags</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This is the first item, just as an example</li>
    <ul>
      <li>but this item is embedded underneath the first item</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I can go further this is the 2nd row of embeddedness (if thats a word!)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This is the 3rd row. I can go further but obviously this is now looking a little convoluted!</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <p>But I can do more, below is an ordered list of my favourite Python libraries</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
    <li>Math</li>
    <li>TensorFlow</li>
  </ol>
  <hr>
  <p>If i wanted to, i could use type="i" to make it i, ii, iii etc. For example:</p>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>Here is an example of this</li>
    <li>Here it is again</li>
  </ol>
  <p>All of the above is what i have achieved today Wed 13th July. I am using Dr Angela Yu's Web development course to learn</p>
